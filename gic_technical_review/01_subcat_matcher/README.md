We want to extend our current list of Rule Matchers for Countries and Tax categories to include subcategories 
We want to apply the spacy Rules Matcher to identify articles that include mentions of these subcategories 


I'm not sure how much longer the list would be, but the length should still be fairly manageable. 

Side note: Other domains currently using Rules Matching 
With the current release of Spacy2.1 (19th March 2019) developers can also use the Rules Matcher in the new Entity Ruler to add rules for the Entity Recognizer neural network to prioritise.
